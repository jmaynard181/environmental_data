#Custom Mean Function
boot_mean = function(x, i)

#Now we can find the bootstrap for 10000 iterations:

#using the dollar sign with str()
str(myboot)

#Lastly, we can extract our bootstrap confidence interval as follows:

#function, as follows:
#For convenience, letâ€™s bind the objects together and transpose the data frame 
#so that the columns represent the mean, 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, and the rows
#represent sampling intensity ranging from 1 to 24.

# ---- Plotting the curve ----
#We can plot the rarefaction curve and the 95% confidence interval using the 
#matplot() function, which is useful for simultaneous plotting of several 
#columns of a data frame or matrix.
#We can also add a legend to make the plot complete, as follows:

matplot(
  rare,
  type='l',
  xlab='Number of sampling plots',
  ylab='Species richness',
  main='Rarefaction Curve')

legend(
  'bottomright',
  legend=c('mean','2.5%','97.5%'),
  lty=c(1,2,3),col=c(1,2,3), inset=c(.1,.1))
