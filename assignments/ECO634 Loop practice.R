#anatomy of a For-Loop
#Loop Variable (i)
#Loop Initiator for ()
#Loop sequence (vector of integers from 1 to 100)

#input for example
for (i in 2)
{
  #print(i)
}

#Loop Variable i
for (i in c(3, 6, 77))
{
  print(i)
}



#1 assigns the first value in the sequence to the loop variable
#2 evaluates the loop body
#3 assigns the next value in the sequence to the loop variable
#4 evaluates the loop body
#Repeat 3 and 4 until the last value in the sequence
#6 exits
